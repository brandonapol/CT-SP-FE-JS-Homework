//? Reading: EJS 11 (Just skim it, this is actually not a 
//? very clearly written chapter)

// HW:

// For Section 4, please continue with the assignments at the GitHub homework link for JS 4. 

//Remember to submit your finished work here via a GitHub link.

// The assignment for today is to create a parking garage class. 
// Parking Garage

// Your parking garage class should have the following methods:
// - takeTicket
// - This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1
// - This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1
// - payForParking
// - Display a prompt() that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable/binding
// - If the payment variable is not empty then (meaning the ticket has been paid) then display a message 
// to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave
// - This should update the "currentTicket" object key "paid" to True
// -leaveGarage
// - If the ticket has been paid, display a message of "Thank You, have a nice day"
// - If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment (You will need to use the prompt() method: see attached link)
// - Once paid, display message "Thank you, have a nice day!"
// - Update parkingSpaces list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the parkingSpaces list)
// - Update tickets list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the tickets list)

// You will need a few attributes as well (Please be sure to use these data types):
// - tickets -> list
// - parkingSpaces -> list
// - currentTicket -> object

// By the end of this project each student should be able to:
// - Explain and/or demonstrate creating classes
// - Explain and/or demonstrate creating class methods
// - Explain and/or demonstrate class instantiation


// When the project is completed, commit the final changes and submit your GitHub link.

// If you want to run it in your console, feel free, but if you want to run it in VS Code, 
// feel free to use the `node filename.js` command in your terminal to execute your JS file.
